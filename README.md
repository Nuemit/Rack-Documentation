# DISCLAIMER
This is an "ON WORK" Project.

# ???
Documenting a network is not really easy, it takes forever, looks complex and is almost always kept up to date by hand.

## What do i want to come up with
Creation of a documentation tool to present infrastructures in a simplified way.

## Thinking
It would be really cool if the network could document itself, wouldn't it?

I'm thinking a lot about how to achieve this to make life easier for sys admins and 1st/2nd level support.

What do we need for this?

Standards!

## What to use for creating such a tool?
I guess the best answer for this is a game engine, javascript or any framework that can work wit svg files. However, in the first place the first few things are for testing purposes, so ill take a game engine to combine my software engineering experiences with gamedev. 

Also Images to have something that looks similiar to a Rack or hubs.

* The Game engine i will use is called [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/)
* At the beginning i will work with verry easy created pngs from paint or gimp.
* Some Stuff to get startet with, like a basic modell of a Switch
  * I will use one Model of an 16 Port Switch at the beginning
    * Name:     Hubx16
    * Nodes:    hub_00 ... hub_15
    * Sprites:  outterframe, bug_f

## What can the solution look like at the and?
Since im not a designer i would maybe go for something similiar like this.

![readable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99821532/155344957-b3546981-9f33-40c2-8362-7cda594a7eb3.png)

its readable and self explaining I guess.
