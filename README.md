Documenting a network is not really easy, it takes forever, looks complex and is almost always kept up to date by hand.

## What do i want to come up with
Creation of a documentation tool to present infrastructures in a simplified way.

## Thinking
It would be really cool if the network could document itself, wouldn't it?

I'm thinking a lot about how to achieve this to make life easier for sys admins and 1st level support.

What do we need for this?

Standards!
